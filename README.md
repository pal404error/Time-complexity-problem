# Time-complexity-problem


#### You are given two machine with capability to solve given problems
```(10^(-4)*(2^n) Seconds and (10^(-6)*(2^n) Seconds respectively.
Implement a program that proves which algorithm is better for input
instance size n=10, 15, 20, 30 and 45. Also print time taken by each
machine for different values on n. Instead of machine A if we choose
to use machine C with capability (10^(-2)*(n^3), what kind of
significant improvement we may get. Show the detail analysis of it
using appropriate tool. [Practical Assignment]```
